Spacebrew Server
================

A dynamically re-routable software toolkit for choreographing interactive spaces. Visit http://www.spacebrew.cc to learn more about spacebrew. On our site we feature a bunch of example apps and tutorials to help you get started. You'll also find a blog where we feature spacebrew projects and events.

Getting Started
---------------  
  
### 1. Install Dependencies  
* Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)  
* Clone the repo from github  
* Install the dependencies using node packaged modules   
    - `npm install`
* Initialize admin submodule
    - ```git submodule update --init```
  
### 2. Run the Server  
* Open terminal and navigate to the base directory of the spacebrew server  
* Run the server by using `node node_server_forever.js`  
  
`node_server_forever.js` vs `node_server.js`
The first of these two files runs node using the forever-monitor node utility. This utility relaunches the spacebrew server if it crashes and it saves logs of the standard output from the spacebrew server to log files in the data/logs directory.

### 3. Connect Client Apps  
* Open the [spacebrew_button example](http://spacebrew.github.io/spacebrew.js/spacebrew_button/index.html?server=localhost&name=button2) - make sure that the `server=` in the query string points to the appropriate host. Customize the `name=` element in the query string to change your apps name.  
* Open the [spacebrew admin interface](http://spacebrew.github.io/spacebrew/admin/admin.html?server=localhost) in another browser window - again, make sure that the `server=` in the query string points to the appropriate host.  
* Start connecting apps and routing data.   
  
Spacebrew Server Options
------------------------ 
Here is an overview of the command line options that the spacebrew server accepts:
```
--port (-p): set the port of the spacebrew server (default 9000)
--help (-h): print help text (which is what you are reading here)
--close (-c): force close clients that don't respond to pings
--ping: enable pinging of clients to track who is potentially disconnected (default)
--noping: opposite of --ping
--timeout (-t): minimum number of ms to wait for response pong before force closing (implies --close, default 10000 [10 seconds])
--persist: saves route configurations that are set via any admin interface
--nopersist: opposite of --persist
--log (-l): sets logging to info level
--loglevel: set logging to info, debug, warn, error
--pinginterval: the number of ms between pings (implies --ping, default 1000 [1 second])
```

Here are a few examples of how to launch the app using command line options:
```
	node node_forever_server.js -p 9011 -t 1000 --pinginterval 1000
	node node_server.js --nopersist --loglevel warn
```

Other Services
-------------- 

### HTTP Link

The HTTP Link (`http_link.js`) is a Node.js app which acts essentially as an HTTP <-> Websocket bridge for Spacebrew. Only `GET` requests are supported currently, so all commands are read from the query string. Responses are provided as JSON.

The HTTP Link allows you to use HTTP-only devices, such as the [Electric Imp](http://electricimp.com/), within the Spacebrew environment. 

1. Register a client by sending a `config` query string key which contains the same json structure as would be sent over Websockets 
    - `http://localhost:9092/?config={"config":{"name":"test","publish":{"messages":[{"name":"output","type":"string"},{"name":"out","type":"string"}]},"subscribe":{"messages":[{"name":"input","type":"string"}]}}}`
    - this is the human-readable version, don't forget to URL encode the data first
* The HTTP Link will respond with a `clientID` that you will use in the future to refer your client.
* You can send messages into the Spacebrew environment by sending a `publish` query string key which contains an array of messages you wish to publish
    - `http://localhost:9092/?clientID=0&publish=[{"message":{"clientName":"test","name":"output","type":"string","value":"hello!"}},{"message":{"clientName":"test","name":"output","type":"string","value":"good bye."}}]`
    - in this case we are sending 2 messages
* You can retrieve sent messages by including `poll=true` in the query string. This will return an array of all messages that have been received by the HTTP Link for your client since the last poll:
    - `http://localhost:9092/?clientID=0&poll=true`
* By default, only one message is queued per subscriber. If you wish to queue more, you can send a `bufferSize` along with your subscriber specifications
    - `http://localhost:9092/?clientID=0&config={"config":{"name":"test","publish":{"messages":[{"name":"output","type":"string"},{"name":"out","type":"string"}]},"subscribe":{"messages":[{"name":"input","type":"string","bufferSize":3}]}}}`
    - this example also shows how you can send a config update
* By default the HTTP Link will remove your client after 5 minutes if there is no queries associated with it. You can change this at any time by specifying a custom `timeout` in seconds
    - `http://localhost:9092/?clientID=0&poll=true&timeout=3600`
    - this example polls for input and also sets a 1-hour timeout

### Command Line Persistent Admin

The Persistent Admin (`node_persistent_admin.js`) is a command line Node.js app which makes sure certain specified publishers and subscribers always stay routed to one-another.

After starting the Persistent Admin (`node node_persistent_admin.js` in the command line/terminal) you can type `help` to get an overview of the various commands available. Basically you can:

* `ls` to get a list of currently-protected routes
* `add myClient,pubOne,theirClient,subscriberUno` to connect the `pubOne` publisher associated with client `myClient` to the `subscriberUno` subscriber associated with client `theirClient`
* `save` to save to disk
* `load` to load from disk (it will automatically load when starting up)
* `remove 0` to remove the zero'th route from protection (when you list the routes via `ls`, the indices listed before each route are what should be used for the remove command)
* `exit` to quit the Persistent Admin
* the `add` command can also be used with regular expressions such as `add myClient,.*,theirClient,.*` to connect all publishers from `myClient` with all compatible subscribers in `theirClient`
